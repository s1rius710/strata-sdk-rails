module Flex
  # Case represents an instance of a business process workflow.
  # It tracks the current step in the process and the overall status.
  #
  # Case models should inherit from this class and add their specific fields.
  #
  # @example Creating a case model
  #   class MyCase < Flex::Case
  #     # Add custom attributes or associations
  #   end
  #
  # Key features:
  # - Tracks the current step in a business process
  # - Manages case status (open/closed)
  # - Associates with an application form
  #
